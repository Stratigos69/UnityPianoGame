Easy way to create Unity piano with a great piano sound

Here is used 3 (2-4) octaves of pre-recorded piano sounds. But in the same time this script have generation of missing octaves/notes.

So why I need to store each note of this 3 octaves? 
Because in this case its sounds much and much better!

You can check how its sounds on the video here:
